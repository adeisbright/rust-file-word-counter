# RUST FILE WORD COUNTER 

This project is a simple CLI aimed at understanding how to work with rust standard library for IO operations especially on files. 

For this project, we want to do the following: 

1. Run the code on the CLI and pass the necessary arguments needed 
2. Read these arguments, and use them to perform IO operations 
3. Return a count of the number of times a given word occur int the file (the word and the file are passed as cli arguments)

This project touches the following concept in Rust : 

1. Variable 
1. Ownership 
1. Conditional Statement
1. Functions 
1. Struct and methods on a struct 
1. Match 
1. Error Handling 
1. Crates and Modules 
1. File Operations
